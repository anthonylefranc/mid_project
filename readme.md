# Ransomware over the years: Impacts and Damages on Businesses (2013-2023)

![ransomwares](https://github.com/anthonylefranc/mid_project/blob/main/resources/ransomwares.png?raw=true)

## Overview
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of various cyber threats, with a specific focus on ransomware. It delves into the most targeted countries and industries and examines the financial and reputational damages inflicted on these companies.

## Project Description
This project aims to dissect the landscape of cyber threats, particularly ransomware, to understand its evolution over time and its impact on businesses globally. By analyzing data from multiple datasets, the project seeks to uncover patterns and trends in ransomware attacks, including the most affected sectors and geographical areas. 

## Development of Analysis Questions/Objectives
The project was initiated with a set of guiding questions focusing on the incidence, nature, and impact of ransomware attacks. Objectives include identifying trends, assessing damage, and predicting future threats.

## Pre-Selection of Datasets
The project involved a careful pre-selection of datasets relevant to the analysis objectives. Criteria for dataset selection included comprehensiveness, reliability, and relevance to the theme of ransomware.

- **Number of datasets reviewed:** 15
- **Number of datasets used:** 4

### Selected Datasets

- **MAIN DATASET:** [Ransomware Attacks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/ransomware-attacks)
- **SECONDARY DATASETS:**
  - [Cyber Security Indexes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katerynameleshenko/cyber-security-indexes) 
  - [State-Sponsored Cyber Operations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/state-sponsored-cyber-operations-2005-present)
  - [World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-and-hacks)

## Refinement of the Subject
The subject was refined to center around ransomware, influenced by current trends and expert knowledge. The intention is to validate and enhance these insights with empirical data analysis.

## Selection of the Final Datasets
The final datasets were chosen based on their ability to answer the research questions effectively. These datasets encompass a broad range of cyber threats, with a particular emphasis on ransomware.

## Development of Cleaning Functions
Cleaning functions were developed to handle specific inconsistencies and issues in the datasets. The team focused on ensuring data quality and relevance for the analysis.

## Cleaning of the Final Dataset
The datasets underwent thorough cleaning, executed by team members Anthony LE FRANC and Céline BREZIN. This process included standardizing data formats, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant entries.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Detailed steps were taken to clean and preprocess the data. Specific attention was given to the normalization and transformation of data for analysis readiness. We used the `CLEANING_FUNCTION.py` file (HOMEMADE) to clean this dataset and others.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to provide initial insights into the data. It included statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Results and Interpretation
Key findings about the impact and trends of ransomware include:
- The number of cyber attacks exploded after COVID.
- The number of ransomware attacks and their severity increased.
- The most impacted sectors are: Academic, Government, and Technology.
- Companies tend to refuse to pay, but it highly depends on their sizes.
- Small and medium-sized companies prefer to pay, while larger ones have backups or do not communicate on this topic for reputational purposes.
- Ransomware is here to stay, is a lucrative and organized business. Applying personal "cyber hygiene" is necessary to prevent such attacks.

To visualize the most significant outcomes:
- Consult our [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony.le.franc/viz/ransomware_analysis_V1/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
- Consult our [Google Slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rb5VhdbESkpwMW7zDoR9JVZb6kLQUWwctOVTxdM_Lpk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Limitations and Further Research
The final datasets collected are poorly sourced and seem to be manually updated to reflect the main incidents that were published in a broad spectrum of media. A consolidation would be necessary to confirm and expand this dataset. Additionally, the regulatory framework in some countries does not oblige companies to formalize that they've been impacted by ransomware, the damages created, the amount ransomed, and the solution found (pay or not the ransom). Our dataset reflects that secrecy. It would be interesting to review and score the ransomware technologies and potential damages.

## Technologies Used
Tools and technologies employed include Python, Pandas, and other data analysis libraries, along with Tableau for data visualization.

## How to Run the Project
Instructions for replicating the analysis or exploring the data.
